        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

        <p><b>Unilateral sacroiliitis</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>The x-ray finding is consistent with unilateral sacroiliitis, given the indistinct SI joint space with pseudo-widening and subchondral sclerosis</li>
          <li>The differential diagnosis for this finding includes psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis. Infection is unlikely given length of symptoms. Other etiologies of spondyloarthropathy remain within the differential noting that ethologies with
            symmetrical disease begin asymmetrically in 50% of cases</li>

        </ul>
