        <li>On examination he has a small shoulder effusion. His range of motion is limited in abduction, flexion, extension to less than 30 degrees in any direction. This is associated with crepitus on examination.</li>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

        <p><b>Hydroxyapatite Deposition Disease (HADD) </b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>HADD is otherwise known as Milwaukee shoulder. </li>
          <li>The features in keeping with this diagnosis on this radiograph include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Intra-articular cloud-like calcifications (dashed line) - note lack of cortex or trabecular pattern to suggest ossified bodies.</li>
            <li>Deformity and collapse of the humeral head (arrows). Prior trauma and neuropathic joint are in the differential diagnosis however the extensive intra-articular calcifications are more in keeping with crystal disease</li>
            <li>Joint distension (dashed arrow)</li>

          </ul>
        </ul>
