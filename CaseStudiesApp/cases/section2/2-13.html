        Clinical Presentation
      </h4>


      <h5>
        History
      </h5>

      <ul>
        <li>22 year old man presents with 4 weeks of worsening midfoot pain on the background of vague pain for 2 months</li>

        <li>He is an avid exerciser, though his pain is present to the point where he can no longer lift weights or run on the treadmill</li>

        <li>It is localized to the midfoot on the plantar aspect, worse with ambulation, better with rest</li>

        <li>No trauma</li>

        <li>No preceding infection</li>

        <li>He was seen in the ER 3 weeks ago, where a radiograph of the foot was performed as well as routine labs</li>

        <li>He tells you that he was discharged home with 30 tabs of Tylenol #3 and recommendations to ice and elevate his foot</li>

        <li>He does not recall being given a diagnosis for his foot pain.</li>

        <li>His pain has not improved since that time.</li>


      </ul>



      <h5>
        Physical Examination
      </h5>



      <ul>
        <li>Appears well. Antalgic gait favouring the right foot on entry to the exam room. </li>

        <li>Temp 36.5 degrees Celsius</li>

        <li>Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot in an well-defined area, both on the plantar and dorsal areas of the foot</li>

        <li>Very minimal swelling over the midfoot posteriorly</li>

        <li>No skin lesion</li>

    <button class="reveal-button" type="button" value='section-155'>Diagnosis</button>
    <div class='hidden-section padding' id='section-155'>

      <p style="font-weight: bold">The most likely diagnosis is: Stress fracture of the right 2nd metatarsal with evidence of fracture healing</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stress fractures are fractures caused by abnormal stress on previously normal bone</li>
        <ul>
          <li><i>This distinguishes them from “insufficiency” fractures which are a result of normal stress on abnormal bone</i></li>

        </ul>

        <li>They are most commonly seen in weight-bearing joints</li>

        <li>Findings can be delayed on x-ray, where the fracture line does not become apparent until there is callus formation - as in this case, follow-up radiographs 1-2 weeks after symptoms may reveal the cause</li>

        <li>Treatment is generally conservative and can consist of rest, and footwear modification</li>

        <li>Surgery is only typically required for cases of non-union</li>
