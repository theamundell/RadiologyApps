                <li>4 sections are presented with varying clinical information. All cases are drawn from
                  real clinical cases.</li>
                <li>Section 1 is <span class="orange">“Spot diagnosis”</span>, whereby one or more diagnostic images
                  are presented and
                  one formulates the best possible answer, sometimes easier said than done.
                  There may be a differential and we will discuss how we chose the final diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Section 2 , <span class="orange">“Extended Cases”</span>, are presented as close as possible to the real-life clinical
                  presentation. This section opens with clinical history and physical examination findings,
                  after which one is asked to first choose a differential diagnosis and then the most appropriate
                  imaging. Imaging studies that were requested in this particular case by the
                  rheumatologist are then presented for one to formulate a final diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Section 3 ,<span class="orange">“Short Cases”</span>,  diagnostic imaging studies are presented for review followed by the
                  “real life” clinical information in that case. One should assess whether the initial diagnosis
                  is altered when reviewed in addition to the clinical information</li>
                <li>Section 3 are <span class="orange">"Spot Cases"</span>, but with a little twist from those in section 1.</li>

                <p>
                  There are many books, journals, and online resources available to individual groups of both rheumatologists and radiologists but very few that cater to both in one product. This book aims to do just that and is intended for all comers from the fields
                  of rheumatology and radiology with a unique approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 17 chapters (426 pages in total) are well laid out, the content of each is concise, and the text within each section is clearly written, with ample tables, illustrations, and images. The book is divided into two main parts. The first part, “Introduction,”
                  comprises four chapters. The first chapter, “Introduction to Imaging,” seems targeted to nonradiologists but is a nice overview of some basic physics and includes general terminology and lists advantages and disadvantages to the various
                  imaging modalities. No doubt rheumatologists, particularly those in training, would find this chapter most useful. The table on contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging is somewhat misleading as almost all listed are relative
                  contraindications and others are not contraindications at all. The remaining chapters in this section are also aimed predominantly at nonradiologists and discuss a diagnostic approach to image analysis and some common image-guided
                  interventional procedures for both diagnosis and treatment. Chapter 3 is divided in terms of muscle, fascia, tendon, ligament, nerve, bursa, bone, joints, cartilage and effusions, each of which is discussed in detail in terms of anatomy
                  and the strengths of various imaging modalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second part (“Imaging in Rheumatology”) is divided into 13 separate chapters on individual arthritides, including separate chapters on topics such as infection, diabetic foot, and bone and synovial tumors. The chapters each follow a similar pattern,
                  and most include excellent tables of various classification systems, nomenclature, and diagnostic criteria. Each section covers the individual topic with clarity and detail, providing many case examples as well as common clinical presentations.
                  In each of the chapters, the authors have included appropriate and up-to-date references.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Images are generally of good quality and plentiful, with clear image legends. The matte finish does not do some of the images justice compared with the glossy finish of some other books; however, there are accompanying applications due out for both iOS
                  and android users that will not doubt be a great addition once available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the real strengths of this book is the appendix, which describes in detail the various scoring systems used, albeit predominantly in research settings. It is very difficult to find this information in one place and so this section is most welcome,
                  not to mention up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ultimately, the book succeeds in what the editor sets out to achieve in merging clinical presentations with imaging patterns of disease in a wide gamut of rheumatologic disorders. Retailing at $249.00 for the hardcover edition (eBook is available for
                  $189.00), this book is not cheap. Although there are some excellent alternative books available that may contain more detail and therefore are targeted at fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists, this book is nonetheless comprehensive
                  and caters to a large target audience of general radiologists, radiology residents, and, in particular, rheumatologists at all levels of training for whom it will be a most excellent resource.

                  Imaging is an essential component in both the diagnosis and management of rheumatic disease, and imaging interpretation is a skill every rheumatologist strives to master. As a rheumatology fellow, imaging was one of the most daunting and challenging areas
                  of the specialty. Useful comprehensive resources were and are both welcome and appreciated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new rheumatology title, Essential Imaging in Rheumatology, is a valuable resource in our field. The book's editor is Dr. John O'Neill, an Associate Professor of Radiology at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. The other contributions are all rheumatologists
                  from McMaster, making this a decidedly Canadian publication!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Essential Imaging in Rheumatology explores all current methods of imaging and imaging techniques related to common rheumatic symptoms and specific rheumatic diseases. This is a well-written and comprehensive resource in its coverage of the rheumatic diseases
                  as well as its description of multiple imaging modalities, including radiographs, ultrasound, bone scan, CT, and MRI. Each section starts with an overview of the clinical aspects of the disease followed by an indepth discussion of
                  the imaging modalities, including examples of high-resolution images, used in diagnosis and management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The authors have done an excellent job tying the clinical aspects of rheumatic diseasesto the radiographic findings. This is an important feature for new learners as they appreciate the relationship between clinical and radiographic findings. The more
                  experienced learner will appreciate exploring some of the more rare diseases or more esoteric radiographic findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This book should be recommended to all PGY-4 and -5 rheumatology trainees as essential reading. It is a concise reference source for radiologists and rheumatologists delivering up-to-date and complete information on the imaging of rheumatic disease.
