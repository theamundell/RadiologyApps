								<ul>
									<li>Radiographic assessment in rheumatology requires a thorough review with an organized approach. There are many different approaches and most radiologists have their own although similar method of assessment. We have developed a very simple, sensible
										mnemonic to use when interpreting hand radiographs in rheumatology:</li>
									<li><b>JABS</b> - <b>J</b>oints/<b>A</b>lignment/<b>B</b>ones/<b>S</b>oft Tissues</li>
									<li>Once we have reviewed the radiograph we need to review any previous studies to assess for interval change. Subtle changes may not be evident on comparison with the most recent exam and only become obvious when distant studies are reviewed, thus
										it is paramount to review back to the original available study.</li>
									<li>Participating in weekly radiology-rheumatology rounds will provide an excellent insight into imaging algorithyms, diagnostics and patient management</li>


								</ul>

							</section>

							<section>
								<ul>
									<li><b>J</b>oints - joint space (normal, widened, narrowed-non/uniform), cortex (normal, erosions, osteophytes, subchondral cysts, sclerosis, new bone formation), pattern distribution of joint involvement (a/symmetrical)</li>
									<li><b>A</b>lignment - normal, deviations, subluxations and dislocations, deformities</li>
									<li><b>B</b>one - mineralization/density, periosteal reaction, new bone formation, acro-osteolysis, fractures, bone lesions </li>
									<li><b>S</b>oft Tissues - normal, atrophy, swelling, calcification, tophus</li>
								</ul>

								<ul>
									<li>It is important to not try to provide an immediate diagnosis. </li>
									<li>Review the radiograph as a whole to get a global perspective with respect to the extent and severity of disease.</li>
									<li>First describe the pathology. Description is key as the use of key descriptive terminology will help you make the diagnosis e.g. erosion with overhanging edge suggests gout.</li>
									<li>Occasionally two arthropathies may co-exist e.g. CPPD arthropathy may be co-existent with other arthropaties in up to 30% cases of patients with arthritis.</li>

									<li>In the rheumatology patient the dominant pathology is usually centred at the joint, hence <b>J/Joint</b> is where we will commence. </li>
									<li>We will want to compare similar joints at the same time, hence we review the DIP joints together, the PIP joints etc.This will allow us to identify subtle changes. </li>
									<li>Assess the <b>joint space</b>, is it maintained uniformly or is it widened (joint effusion/synovial thickening) or narrowed (cartilage loss). </li>
									<li>Review the <b>cortex and subchondral bone plate</b>, are there any focal cortical defects to suggest an erosion. If there is an erosion assess it size and percentage involvement with respect to the articulating surface of the involved bone, use
										the additional views. </li>
									<li>Erosion location: central (e.g. erosive OA, psoriatic arthritis), marginal/periarticular (e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis) or juxta-articular or even remote from the joint (e.g. gout).</li>
									<li>Erosion margin: a sclerotic margin may indicate an inactive and/or healing erosion or may be a pressure-type erosion as occurs in gout, a lack of a sclerotic margin suggests an active erosion (new bone unable to be laid down due to active disease).
										</li>
									<li>Is there new bone formation, if so is it typical of an osteophyte (degenerative disease), enthesophyte or new bone related to a seronegative arthropathy. </li>
									<li>Is there periosteal reaction which would again suggest a seronegative disease in the absence of trauma or infection.
									</li>
									<li>Assess the <b>subchondral bone</b>, is there increased subchondral sclerosis or cyst formation to suggest degenerative disease. </li>

									<li>Remember to review all the radiographs as reducible subluxations may not be apparent on the PA view (hands are placed on flat on table for PA radiographs which may cause reducible deformities to return to a normal alignment but recur in the oblique
										view e.g. Jaccound’s arthropathy).</li>

									<li>Is it localized or generalized, unilateral or bilateral (if both hands or alternate site are available for comparison).

									<li>Is there a visible cause e.g.trauma related or disuse. If localized is it periarticular, what joints are involved.
									</li>
									<li>If a single joint is involved always consider infection in the differential diagnosis. </li>
									<li>If generalized calculate the metacarpal index (The metacarpal index (MCI), the combined cortical mid-metacarpal thickness divided by the outer mid-metacarpal diameter, can be measured for the index finger or as a combined measurement of the second
										to fourth digits. Values are age related but combined cortical width should be greater than 50% width mid-metacarpal)
									</li>
									<li>Assess for new bone formation and for periosteal reaction (both may occur in seronegative arthritis) and for subperiosteal resorption (e.g. hyperparathyroidism)</li>
									<li>Increased bone density may occur with avascular necrosis, e.g. Kienbock’s disease of the lunate and may go on to osseous collapse.</li>
									<li>Assess phalangeal tufts for acro-osteolysis, bone resorption distal phalanges. This has a wide differential including scleroderma and Raynaud’s </li>

										suggest tendinous and/or tenosynovitis of the ECU, commonly seen in Rheumatoid arthritis. </li>
									<li>Is there swelling overlying a joint suggesting an underlying joint effusion/synovitis. This will alert me to closely review this joint for pathology. </li>
									<li>Is there generalized swelling of an entire digit, dactylitis, this may suggest infection or seonegative disease such as psoriatic arthropathy. </li>
									<li>Soft tissue loss, particularly distally would suggest scleroderma. </li>
									<li>Is there soft tissue calcification, is it within expected location of a tendon (calcific tendinosis in hydroxyapatite disease), or evidence of calcinosis cutis e.g. SLE. </li>
									<li>Vascular calcification distally extending to the hands is uncommon and is usually suggestive of chronic diabetes or chronic renal disease. Assess for changes of hyperparathyroidism. </li>
