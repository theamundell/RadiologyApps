							<h2>Conventional Radiography</h2>
						</section>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li>This is the starting point for evaluation of all arthritides as radiographs are readily available, inexpensive, and offer excellent spatial resolution.</li>

								<li>Standard views should be obtained in at least two projections.</li> 

								<li>Additional views may also be required for some joints, such as the Norgaard (ball catcher’s) view, which are important in looking for erosions of the hands, e.g., radial aspects of the metacarpal heads, which may not be visible on the AP or lateral radiographs.
								</li>

								<li>Occasionally asymptomatic joints should also be imaged as they may present additional helpful findings, e.g. bilateral feet radiographs may demonstrate asymptomatic erosions in suspected RA patients. </li>

								<li><b>Radiographs can also localize pathology that can then be assessed with other imaging modalities if clinically indicated.</b> Radiographs can demonstrate pathology, e.g. chondrocalcinosis, and distribution patterns that may be difficult to appreciate on alternate imaging.</li>

							<h2>Ultrasound</h2>
						</section>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li>Ultrasound has developed rapidly in the last decade in assessing patients with inflammatory arthritis, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis</li>
								<li>It is becoming an adjunct to the clinical examination with increased direct use in the rheumatology office</li>

								<li>The use of power Doppler has allowed for more effective analysis of synovitis and erosions in superficial joints. This allows for confirmation of active disease and allows the rheumatologist and patient to make informed decisions on treatment on the same outpatient appointment. </li>

								<li>Ultrasound can also assess for joint effusions and tendon and tendon sheath pathology and can assess multiple joints at the same setting. </li>

								<li><i>However</i>, ultrasound is operator dependent and has a long learning curve. As such, many rheumatology centers are developing alongside dedicated musculoskeletal imaging centers.</li>


							</ul>

							<h2>Computed Tomography (CT)</h2>
						</section>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li>CT scans offer excellent spatial resolution. It is the gold imaging standard in the assessment of erosive disease. </li>

								<li>Its general use, however, is limited by its significant radiation burden and the availability of ultrasound and MRI.</li>

						<section class="header">
							<h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h2>
						</section>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li>This technique offers excellent soft tissue contrast</li>
								
								<li>MRI can determine the extent of synovitis, pannus, effusions, and tendon and tendon sheath pathologies as can be demonstrated on ultrasound</li>

								<li>MRI is not however limited to detailed assessment of superficial joints. In addition MRI can delve beneath the bone cortex, a limitation in ultrasound. Bone marrow edema and pre-erosive disease can be readily appreciated.</li>

								<li>MRI is usually limited to evaluation of a single region, e.g., MRI of the hand and elbow requires two separate bookings due to time requirements and the field of view, which is balanced against image resolution, whereas ultrasound can image multiple joints at the same examination.</li>

							</ul>

						<section class="header">
							<h2>Scintigraphy</h2>
						</section>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li>Radionuclide bone scans are not as popular as they once were since the more widespread introduction of the MRI</li>
								<li>They were used historically to evaluate the distribution of arthritis in different joints.</li>
								<li>To distinguish infections from inflammatory arthritis, indium-labeled leukocytes or gallium scans can be employed.</li>
								<li>It can be useful in determining the activity in patients with Paget’s disease of the bone.</li>
