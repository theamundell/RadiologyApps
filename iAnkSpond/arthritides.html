								<li>There are two main subtypes, limited and diffuse systemic sclerosis.</li>
								<li>Scleroderma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to vascular malfunction, inflammation and fibrosis.</li>
								<li>The CREST syndrome is a variant of scleroderma with its own acronym defined as Calcinosis, Raynaud’s, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasia.</li>
								<li>Musculoskeletal involvement is present in 61% of patients. Usually presents with bilateral symmetrical pain and swelling with underlying synovitis. Hand involvement common- wrists, MCPJ, PIPJ and DIPJs.</li>
								<li>Erosive arthropathy is present in 21% and may be associated with joint space loss and periarticular osteopenia in up to 23% of patients.</li>
								<li>Occaionally there can be pencil in cup deformity of the PIP and DIPJs simulating psoriatic arthritis.</li>
								<li>Acro-osteolysis and phalangeal tuft resorption is characteristic and is associated with digital ulcers due to compromised blood flow. This can lead to penciling and total digital destruction.</li>
								<li>Synovitis may be evident radiographically as periarticular swelling, as can tenosynovitis</li>
								<li>Flexion contractures occur in up to 27% in late stage disease</li>
								<li>Calcinosis cutis is common and may be focal or extensive with respect to a digit, may be associated with digital ulcers. Usually dominant hand or areas chronic stress involved</li>

										<li>
											Intermediate phase:
											<ul>
												<li>soft tissue tophi develop (often nodular and of slight increased attenuation)</li>
												<li>periosteum adjacent to tophi may develop a lace like appearance which may progress to an erosion.</li>
												<li>Classically extra-articular erosions have a punched out appearance with sclerotic margins and an overhanging edge.</li>
												<li>Articular erosions begin marginally and progress centrally. </li>

												<li>Reactive new bone formation may occur with mushroom effect.</li>
												<li>Subchondral intra-osseous gout appear as subchondral radiolucencies</li>

								<li>Women are affected more commonly then men, ratio 3:1, with a peak incidence in middle age. There is a modest familial predisposition </li>
								<li>Characterized by synovial proliferation and inflammation with resulting soft tissue swelling, synovial neovascularisation, bone erosions, bone marrow oedema, cartilage destruction and periarticular osteopenia. These are the pathological hallmarks

							<ul>
								<li>Multi system non-caveating granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology with variable presentation and prognosis</li>
								<li>Musculoskeletal involvement in 1-13% of sarcoidosis patients with estimated average of 5%</li>
								<li>Bone and joint pain are common symptoms. </li>
								<li>Arthropathy is usually symmetric and transient</li>
								<li>The hands and feet are most commonly affected.</li>
								<li>Acute sarcoid arthritis often occurs in the context of Löfgren syndrome - triad of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and arthritis / arthralgias</li>
								<li>Most common joint involved is the ankle, followed by the knee, wrist, and MCP joints</li>
								<li>In the vast majority of cases acute sarcoid arthritis is a benign, self-limited disease with minimal or no joint destruction </li>
								<li>However may also present with a granulomatous arthritis that induces synovitis and can have a chronic transient or relapsing course. Usually oligoarticular involving ankles, knees, PIPJs hands and wrists</li>
								<li>Muscular sarcoid may occur</li>
							</ul>

							<ul>
								<li>Classic sarcoid lesions of the small bones of the hands demonstrate a “lace-like” trabecular pattern i.e. areas with cyst-like licences of different sizes, and/or extensive bone erosions.</li>
								<li>Small punched out cortical lesions of the phalangeal heads are the most common</li>
								<li>Soft tissue swelling is often present. </li>
								<li>Joint spaces are typically preserved.</li>
								<li>Joint destruction or Jaccoud deformity, when it occurs, is secondary to persistent inflammation</li>
								<li>Periarticular inflammation is common e.g. tenosynovitis</li>
								<li>The majority of cases of sarcoid arthritis, whether acute or chronic, are oligoarthritic or polyarthritic in nature</li>
								<li>Less common findings include subperiosteal bone resorption, acro-osteolysis, acro-osteosclerosis and bone destruction with pathological fractures</li>
							</ul>

							<p>* Note: When patients with sarcoidosis present with symmetric polyarthritis, especially small joints of the hands, clinicians should evaluate for concomitant rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
